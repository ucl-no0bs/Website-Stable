# Description

Part of Scenario Week 3. Have to design safe/unsafe websites, and hack into the unsafe one to demonstrate security issues.

This is the repo for the unsafe website.
We hack into it manually and by using penetration tools.

The database we use is in another repo from this group. The secure website is also located in another repo
