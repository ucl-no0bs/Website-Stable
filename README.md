# Description

Part of Scenario Week 5. The aim is to design vulnerable/secure websites, and hack into the vulernable one to demonstrate security issues.

* This is the repo for the secure website. The "vulernable" site repo can be found here: https://github.com/ucl-no0bs/Website

* The secure site is hosted on an Ubuntu 16.04 server making use of Microsoft's Azure service. It can be found here: http://sw5groupc.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com/

* Hacking was performed manually and through the use of penetration tools. Written scripts and code can be found here: https://github.com/ucl-no0bs/Hacking-Tools

* The database used can be found here: https://github.com/ucl-no0bs/Database


## Setup

For both environment testing and Azure, the following were used to enable hosting:

1. [Apache2 HTTP server] (https://httpd.apache.org/)
2. [PHP7] (https://secure.php.net/manual/en/migration70.new-features.php)
3. [MySQL] (https://www.mysql.com/)

In order to assist with development, [MAMP] (https://www.mamp.info/en/) was made use of on developer machines in order to simplify the "AMP" setup and management process.

In addition to the above, the secure site uses [Securimage] (https://www.phpcaptcha.org/) to assist with the implementation of our Captcha security measure.
