# Description

Part of Scenario Week 3. Have to design safe/unsafe websites, and hack into the unsafe one to demonstrate security issues.

This is the repo for the safe website.
The vulnerabilities of the other website (which is in another repo from this group) have been fixed here.

The database we use is also in another repo from this group.
